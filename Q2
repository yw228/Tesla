/*Write a function solution that, given two integers A and B, returns the number of integers from the range [A..B] (ends are included) which can be expressed as the product of two consecutive integers, that is X^ * (X + 1) for some integer X.

test-inp

Examples:

1. Given A = 6 and B = 20 the function should return 3. These Integers are: 6=2*3, 12-34 and 20 = 4*5.

2. Given A = 21 and B = 29 , the function should return 0. There are no integers of the form X^ * (X + 1) in this interval

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

A and B are integers within the range [1 1,000,000,000), As B
